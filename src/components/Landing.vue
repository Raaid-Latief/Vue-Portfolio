  <P class="p-2">I'm a hard-working and passionate person. I love seeing progress, and if I am committed to something, I make sure to go all out. I'm not afraid of failure because there's always room to improve. I am gentle and always willing to advise as I love seeing people succeed. 
    Since I was a toddler, I have always been fascinated by technology and video games. My dream job is to work as a developer. I've always been curious about it and I always like to learn more about it. I did an IT learnership last year and had to drop out as I preferred to be the one developing the websites. This motivated me to pursue this field of work.
